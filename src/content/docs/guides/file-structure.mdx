title: "File Structure of typical Volar project"
---

This guide will show you how a Volar project is organized and what the different files in your project do.

## Files and directories

Due to needing multiple packages to run the language server and VS Code extension, a Volar project will typically live in a monorepo. This is not a requirement, but it is the most common setup and recommended way to set up a Volar project.

### Server (`packages/language-server`)

All files related to the language server are located in the `packages/language-server` directory.

- `package.json` — Configuration for the language server package, including its dependencies and main entry point.
- `bin/server.js` — The entry point for the language server binary. This file is responsible for starting the language server.
- `src/index.ts` — Main file for the language server, setting up the server and its capabilities.
- `src/language.ts` — Defines the language capabilities and provides methods for handling the project's files.

### Client (`packages/vscode`)

All files related to the VS Code extension are located in the `packages/vscode` directory.

- `package.json` — Configuration for the VS Code extension package, including its dependencies, main entry point, and activation events.
- `src/extension.ts` — Main file for the VS Code extension, setting up the client and activating features.
- `scripts/build.js` — Script for building the VS Code extension.

## Full example

Your Volar project will, in most cases, look similar to the following:

import FileTree from "../../../components/Filetree.astro";

<FileTree>

- .vscode/
  - launch.json
  - tasks.json
- packages/
  - language-server/
    - bin/
      - server.js
    - src/
      - index.ts
      - ...
    - package.json
    - tsconfig.json
  - vscode/
    - scripts/
      - build.js
    - src/

      - ...
    - .vscodeignore
    - package.json
    - tsconfig.json

</FileTree>

Some generic files such as `README.md` were omitted for brevity.
