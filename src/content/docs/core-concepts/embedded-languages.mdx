title: Embedded languages
description: VolarJS has top-notch support for embedded languages and can drastically simplify the mappings needed to get editing features working across the different parts of your files.

On the web, most programming languages are composed of other programming languages. The most common example is HTML, in which you will find JavaScript and CSS in `<script>` and `<style>` blocks respectively. You can even find some inline CSS in the `style` attribute of HTML elements, and some inline JavaScript in the `onclick` (and other events) attribute of HTML elements.

There is actually a remarkable number of examples of this behaviour: The different blocks in [Vue's Single-File Components](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html), the sections in [Svelte's components](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-components) or the frontmatter syntax and JSX-based component template of [Astro's components](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/).

As such, Volar was built on the principle that it is highly likely that your language will have such embedded languages and has top-notch support for them. Notably, Volar can drastically simplify the mappings needed to get editing features working across the different parts of your files.

**If your language does not have embedded languages: That's completely okay!** Volar will still work for you just as well, and it will be ready if one day you do decide to add embedded languages to your language.
